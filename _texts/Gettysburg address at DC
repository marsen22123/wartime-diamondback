            <p>NOW WE ARE ENGAGED IN A GREAT<lb/>CIVIL WAR TESTING WHETHER THAT<lb/>NATION OR ANY
                NATION SO CON~<lb/>CEIVED AND SO DEDICATED CAN LONG<lb/>ENDURE . WE ARE MET ON A
                GREAT<lb/>BATTLEFIELD OF THAT WAR . WE HAVE<lb/>COME TO DEDICATE A PORTION
                OF<lb/>THAT FIELD AS A FINAL RESTING<lb/>PLACE FOR THOSE WHO GAVE<lb/>THEIR LIVES
                THAT THAT NATION<lb/> MIGHT LIVE . IT IS ALTOGETHER FIT~<lb/>TING AND PROPER THAT WE
                SHOULD<lb/> DO THIS . BUR IN A LARGER SENSE<lb/>WE CAN NOT DEDICATE~WE CAN
                NOT<lb/>CONSECRATE~WE CAN NOT HALLOW~<lb/>THIS GROUND . THE BRAVE MEN LIV~<lb/>ING
                AND DEAD WHO STRUGGLED HERE<lb/>HAVE CONSECRATED IT FAR ABOVE<lb/>OUR POOR POWER TO
                ADD OR DETRACT .<lb/>THE WORLD WILL LITTLE NOTE NOR<lb/>LONG REMEMBER WHAT WE SAY
                HERE<lb/>BUT IT CAN NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY<lb/>DID HERE . IT IS FOR US THE
                LIVING<lb/>RATHER TO BE DEDICATED HERE TO<lb/>THE UNFINISHED WORK WHICH THEY<lb/>WHO
                FOUGHT HERE HAVE THUS FAR<lb/>SO NOBLY ADVANCED . IT IS RATHER FOR<lb/>US TO BE HERE
                DEDICATED TO THE<lb/>GREAT TASK REMAINING BEFORE US~<lb/>THAT FROM THESE HONORED
                DEAD<lb/>WE TAKE INCREASED DEVOTION TO<lb/>THAT CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY GAVE
                THE<lb/>LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION ~<lb/>THAT WE HERE HIGHLY RESOLVE
                THAT<lb/>THESE DEAD SHALL NOT HAVE DIED IN<lb/>VAIN ~ THAT THIS NATION UNDER
                GOD<lb/>SHALL HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM~<lb/>AND THAT GOVERNMENT OF THE
                PEOPLE<lb/>BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE SHALL<lb/>NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH .</p>
